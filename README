Django SuperTagging

Inspired by django-tagging, this project came up when we wanted to
automate content tagging. Using OpenCalais service we are able to retrieve
a large array of data, including basic entities (tags) and relations (attributes
about the tag).

Prerequisites
	- simplejson ( http://pypi.python.org/pypi/simplejson )
